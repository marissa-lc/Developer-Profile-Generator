# Developer-Profile-Generator
A command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username

#### this app uses node.js and inquirer to generate a pdf profile that can be used to cleanly display information from your git hub profile.

#### How it works

* user will run npm install 
* once all packages are installed user will enter "node index.js" which will start the inquirer prompts
* user will be asked their github username
* user will be asked to pick a color from "blue", "green", "pink", and "red"
* once the user has gone through the two prompts and hit enter it will generate a pdf file

The PDF should have:

* profile image
* github username
* luser's ocation
* user bio (from github)
* number of repositories on github
* number of followers on github 
* number of stars on github
* number of user's following github account
